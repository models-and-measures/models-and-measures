## Presentation

Models & Measures is a research group financed by the Emergences Program of the Paris City Council.
The goal is to develop approximation methods coupling Models and Data Measurements.

In many areas of science, industry and their applications, decisions are taken based on predictions of the state of a physical system (concentration of pollutants in the city, blood flux in an artery, population of neutrons in a nuclear core...). In addition, some of these decisions need to be taken in real time, requiring continuous updates on the system's state.

State estimation has usually been done either by using data from measuring devices and then approximating with interpolation techniques, or by physical modeling, usually leading to the solution of partial differential equations.

Both approaches lead to different yet incomplete descriptions of the system since it is usually too complex to be perfectly sampled or modeled. In this project, we aim to develop approximation methods that couple both approaches in order to complement their strengths. A key role will be played by model reduction methods, which will allow to reduce the intrisic high dimensionality of the problems.
